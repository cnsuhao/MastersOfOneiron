## The Ekelplithfs
Ekelplithfs are blueish cyclopes that live on the light side of the mattershell. They are sleeping souls that were summoned into Oneiron to restore the world.  
Their culture could be discribed as being tribal magidustrial fropconomy. They're fond of gadgets and technology but afraid of the dark. They like to play a mix of golf and rugby.  
Ekelplithfs can swim between platforms and dive to the other side, although heavy equipment needs an elevator or bridge to come along. Light equipment slows them down a bit. Also they're afraid of the dark.

They cultivate frop both as their food and construction material.

Their leaders wear their kilts as headgear to prove they're chilling in the bathtub on portraits. It is common sense that the best decisions are made in safe and comfy waters.
