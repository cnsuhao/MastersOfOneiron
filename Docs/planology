The world consists of four planes:
-One god-player, optional number of bots. Can be edited (strange fenomenon)
-One god-player, multiple bots (forces of nature and factions). Story mode.
-Infinite human god-players
-Infinite human kekel-players and kekel-bots

Planes can be imagined as concentric bubbles spotted with rocky flakes of varying size around the central star.
Each plane thus has two sides, the inside facing the central star and the outside facing away from it.
The inside:
	- Light
	- Frop
	- Trees
The outside:
	- Darkness
	- Mushrooms
	- Nightmarish photophobic creatures
	- Hostile
Both sides:
	- Magnite

So you may think: "Why go to the outside at all?"
Well there are several reasons:
Strategic stealthy covert ops reasons during wartime.
Nightmare hunters (yes, they make great mercenaries) go to the outside for sport.
The main reason though, is that on the outside of the planes there grows a special kind of mushroom which helps the Kekelplithfs enter the summoning/conversion state.
In this state more Kekelplithfs can be summoned or non-friendly Kekelplithfs can be converted.
