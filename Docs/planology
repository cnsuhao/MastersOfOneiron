The world consists of four planes:

-One player, optional number of bots. Can be edited (strange fenomenon)
-One player, multiple bots (forces of nature and factions). Story mode.
-Infinite human players (Monotheists)
-Infinite human players and custom bots allowed

Planes can be imagined as patchy spherical shells layered around a central star. Each plane thus has two sides, one facing the central star, the other facing away from it.
The inside:
	- Light
	- Fecundity
The outside:
	- Dark
	- Mushrooms
	- Nightmarish photophobic creatures
	- Hostile

So you may think: "Why go to the outside at all?"
Well there are several reasons:
Strategic stealthy covert ops reasons during wartime.
Nightmare hunters (yes, they make great mercenaries) go to the outside for sport.
The main reason though, is that on the outside of the planes there grows a special kind of mushroom which helps the Kekelplithfs enter the summoning state. In this state more Kekelplithfs can be summoned.
