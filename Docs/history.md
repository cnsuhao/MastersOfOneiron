Two seconds ago both hemisphere leaders of the Progenitors simultaniously blew up their planet with the very same latest top-secret technology in an attempt to end all wars, at this they failed. The resulting blast travels so fast that time slows down to a point where it allowed new life forms to come into existence in what we would experience as a single second.  

The debris forms a shell that has two sides, the inside being lit by the imploding part of the blast. On this side plants grow abundantly and among them walks the Kekelplithf. The Kekelplithf lives a quiet life in the coreglow: Swimming from platform to platform, looking for food, making Frop salad. He's the fastest swimmer in all of Oneiron, so no predator will ever catch him.  
He does get lonely more and more. One moment he finds Frop that has been eaten, while he knows no other creature that eats Frop. It is poisonous to most and others prefer to eat other creatures. Maybe this creature would like to try his Frop salad, and the Kekelplith keeps his eye out for a creature munching Frop.  
When he finally spots her she turns to be a shy one. Right before she takes a bite of some juicy Frop the Gogoltov sees the Kekelplithf, changes shape and zooms to the dark side of the platform.

On the dark outside of the mattershell hovers the Gogoltov among fungi. It feeds on the Soulshroom which allows it to manipulate other fungi. To create offspring it must eat Frop. Otherwise it is not able to form eggshells.

Both the Kekelplith and the Gogoltov were created simultaneously when a discharge from the core hit a more primitive creature. Neither age.
Their purpose is to undo the destruction of the planet, and although they do not know this yet, they _are_ both looking to live more meaningful lives.
