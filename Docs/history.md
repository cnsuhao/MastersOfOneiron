Somewhere, a planet is divided into two nations of about the same size. The leaders of both these hemispheres are presented with the very same latest top-secret destructive technology by the planet's last remaining weapon firm. This new weapon of (potentially) mass destruction turns iron into a highly unstable element within a defined region, without warning.

With no chance of retaliation and the guaranteed instant elimination of the other, neither of the leaders hesitate to make the deal. You never know when you might need it. But at soon as the deal is made and the remote handed over, they are told the same deal is being made with the other. Compelled to survive, two buttons are pressed, synchronous like clockwork, and the planet explodes.

The resulting blast travels so fast that time escapes into the imaginary, dimming the stars and increasing the influence spirit has on matter. On top of that all this spirit (or dream) energy has been instantly united with the planet's destruction.

Realizing what is happening, this newborn world soul utilizes its increased influence in an attempt to keep this precious combination of elements together, as it sees the only alternative is eternal loneliness.

Applying the strongest cyclotomic field it can imagine the spirit is able to contain the exploding planet within a triacontahedric cycle. Effectively halting the explosion by bending space. As long as the field is maintained, there may be a chance of restoring the planet, life and plurality of conciousness. But the spirit knows that first it must be patient. With a bit of luck, life will emerge that is able to assist.

As the slow blast turns to a flow the water forms a triacontrahedric film and the atmosphere resettles on each side of this surface. At the icosahedric extremes rock is pressed together to a boiling point forming volcanoes that hurl glowing rocks into their surroundings. The heat of the volcanoes causes water to vaporize which drifts away over to the dodecahedric points, where they form clouds, that produce rain and thunder.

The rocky platforms that form have two sides, the inside being lit by the planet's core which basically turned into a small star, the outside is in eternal darkness. On the light side plants grow abundantly and among them walks the Ekelplitf. The Ekelplitf lives a quiet life in the coreglow: Swimming from platform to platform, looking for food, making Frop salad. He's the fastest swimmer in all of Oneiron, so no predator will ever catch him.  
He does get lonely more and more. One moment he finds Frop that has been eaten, while he knows no other creature that eats Frop. It is poisonous to most and others prefer to eat other creatures. Maybe this creature would like to try his Frop salad, and the Kekelplith keeps his eye out for a creature munching Frop.  
When he finally spots her she turns to be a shy one. Right before she takes a bite of some juicy Frop the Gogoltov sees the Kekelplithf, changes shape and zooms to the dark side of the platform.

On the dark outside of the mattershell hovers the Gogoltov among fungi. It feeds on the Soulshroom which allows it to manipulate other fungi. To create offspring it must eat Frop. Otherwise it is not able to form eggshells.

Both the Kekelplith and the Gogoltov were created simultaneously when a discharge from the core hit a more primitive creature. Neither age.
Their purpose is to undo the destruction of the planet, and although they do not know this yet, they _are_ both looking to live more meaningful lives.
