### Story
Two seconds ago both hemisphere leaders of the Progenitors simultaniously blew up their planet with the very same latest top-secret technology in an attempt to end all wars, at this they failed. The resulting blast travels so fast that time slows down to a point where it allowed new life forms to come into existence in what we would experience as a single second. Nature's laws are a bit wonky under these circumstances.

The blast force is compensated by gravity which reaches an equilibrium at a certain radius where the debris has cluttered to form a shell of platforms that have a light and a dark side. The Kekelplithf is most comfortable in the light and are fast swimmers. The Gogoltov prefers the dark, although the light coming through between platforms does allow them to fly.
