# Masters of Oneiron
My first fully open source school project. Masters of Oneiron will be a 2.5D RTS featuring battling platforms in dreamspace. MoO is being developed in C++ using QtCreator as IDE and Urho3D as it's game engine. Graphics are made in Blender, Inkscape and Gimp. Audiosamples will be made with supercollider UML diagrams in Dia. Platform of development: Xubuntu GNU/Linux.

Controls:
WASDQE, Mouse movement and left click.
